            <h2>Solution Description <i class="fa-solid fa-file-contract"></i></h2>
            <p>My solution to this problem is to use cell 
                phones to better connect people. "Phone renters"
                will be placed in as many public buildings
                as possible. These renters will allow people
                to rent phones and use them how they want,
                 but will cost $20 with a 12 hour limit (will have fees).

            <p class="FAQ">Q. What is the estimated cost to carry out this solution?</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> A. It includes the iPhone 11, $500, the table,
                which costs around $1000, the Bluetooth Mobile Credit
                Card Reader, $25, and the GPS Screen, around $100.</p>
            
                <p class="FAQ">Q. How will it work?</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> A. First, the customer will swipe his/her membership
                    card, credit card, etc. Then, the phone is unlocked
                    and you are allowed to take the phone. Enter in your
                    name on the screen and it will start recording your
                    statistics. The screen is for people to see how much
                    time has elapsed, and who has it.
                </p>

                <p class="FAQ">Q. Where will they be located?</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> A. Any local or public building willing
                    to install the phones, but mostly in poor cities
                     or towns.
